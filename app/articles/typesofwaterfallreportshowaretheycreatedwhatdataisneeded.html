                        In Waterfall projects there often are Status Reports which list the tasks in the current work packages and their status. The tasks come from an agreed, project-wide Work Breakdown Structure. (Managementhelp.org) A project status report is a good window for external stakeholders and users to get an understanding about what is going on in your project. So certainly there is not the place to put any surprises about your project. The first rule of thumb in your project of status report is what not to put in it and it is not to put surprises. Don’t put your over budget, over schedule, out of resources or your deliverables negative aspects in it as they may go out to the CEO of your company. So what actually goes into your report?

                        Timesheet: The timesheet reflects the different time tracked and resources that are being used on the project. Teammates mostly look at the timesheets because they are accountable. Timesheets are usually weekly.

                         Expenses: are factors in the project that require money or anything from the stakeholders and team mates of the project. It can be things such as travel expenses like airfare, cabs, and meals. Supplies are another expense. Equipment is another expense as well. (Lucidchart.com)

                        It is important to keep it synced, accurate timely and up to date. So these are a few things that are needed in a waterfall report in order to make a more secure establishment of a project between the stakeholders and team workers.
