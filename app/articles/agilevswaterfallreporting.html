                        With many tech firms and teams moving towards integrating Agile in all parts of their business processes, it's helpful to take a step back and take a look at the differences and inherent challenges one might face when moving from different methodologies when it comes to reporting. Both agile and waterfall processes consider reporting to be important. It is, in fact, a great way of communicating progress, status, and documenting for the future. We're going to take a look at how agile reporting is different than waterfall reporting and how one might be better than the other given a certain context.

                        Agile's overarching goal is to be iterative and constantly finding ways of improvements in small areas that, over time, snowball into a large and perceivable ways. Agile reporting focuses primarily on status and small updates that capture the context of a given sprint or time in the project (2). A great idea for making agile reports effective in achieving the goals of quick, iterative integration of feedback is to label points of the reports in colors such as red (bad), blue (neutral), green (good), orange (warning). This gives readers a quick idea of what is going well and what needs to be worked on.

                        Waterfall reporting is much more structured in goals and what it sets out to do. Ultimately, in waterfall you are at a phase of the process and your goal is to stick through that phase through thick and thin. If something goes wrong or unexpected you are not expected to stop everything and solve it, since that would derail the project timeline which you agreed upon towards the beginning.

                        In reality, most organizations are not 100% agile nor are they still 100% waterfall (1). In your career you will be expcted to interact with both processes even if it is not in name. You must be ready to know how to handle both reporting styles and the overarching goals of both.
