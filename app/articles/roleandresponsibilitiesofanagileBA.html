                        More and more organizations are going towards to an agile project delivery framework. Focusing on an Agile BA in a project development environment, we traditionally know these as the middle man between the project and the business. Putting and Agile and Business analyst together makes an Agile BA. When we look at the skillsets of an Agile BA we see they need to induct, analyze, communicate, and document requirements. The Agile BA inducts requirements to understand what the business/project needs but also work with business stakeholders on the team. They usually want to analyze requirements as they come. So from the top priorities they work off the prioritize requirements list. They are still documenting but in the form of a user story. They also still communicating requirements daily. The skill sets of a BA are still required in an Agile world. It just reigns a different level of engagement at a different time.

                        In these debates many claim that a business analyst is, and really always has been agile. “The profession of analyzing the business requires flexibility, responsiveness, creativity, innovative thinking, acceptance of change, and a dependence on individuals and interactions.” (Steve Blais. What is an Agile Business Analyst?) Such qualities are desired, if not required, regardless of whether the business analyst is involved with agile software development, traditional software development, or no software development at all. Vital characteristics of an Agile BA are adaptability, goal orientation, Innovation, leadership, empathy, and anticipation. Carrying those traits will make you a successful BA. The Agile BA’s goal is to add value to the business by solving business problems. While the developers are focusing on constructing fresh parts of working software, the Agile BA has their eye on the overall task that will be solved when the whole project is finished. The Agile BA is dedicated to solving business difficulties anywhere they occur in the industry however they may be resolved. Therefore, the Agile BA must be able to adapt to the business process. The Agile Business Analyst’s goal is to add usefulness to the corporation by solving business problems. Carrying the trait of innovation, the BA is always looking for new approaches for solving business tasks and improvements to the business processes. Finally, leadership is a very important trait coming from an Agile BA because as they oversee the entire mechanics of the business, their position focuses on the team and the project.  This leadership factor is not achieved through authority, but through influence and through facilitation and communication.” (Steve Blais. What is an Agile Business Analyst?) so in conclusion, the skill sets of a BA are still required in an Agile world. Having those skills with equipped knowledge and experience in working with Agile, put those together, and you have an Agile BA
