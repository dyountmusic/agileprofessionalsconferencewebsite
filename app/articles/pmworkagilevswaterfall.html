                    <intro>
                        The work done by a project manager of course varies from project to project, but in general there are some similarities in project managers working in an Agile environment versus a Waterfall environment.
                    </intro>
                    <p>
                        In an Agile environment a project manager is responsible for managing things like cost, scope, communication, procurement, risk, quality control, and more [1]. They must do all of these things as a Scrum Master, more of a facilitator position than an authoritative leadership role[2]. This is where project managers used to the Waterfall environment might struggle at first.

                    <p>
                        In a Waterfall environment the project manager’s role is more of a rigid, authoritative figure that can guide their team more than cooperate. That is a consequence of Waterfall having one deadline at the end of their project instead of working in sprints [3]. In that kind of environment one could make an argument for things like “death marches” that plague Waterfall teams. If you are a project manager on a Waterfall team, depending on the company and situation, you may be forced to facilitate a death march. If your higher ups absolutely need x-product at y-time, and your team won’t be ready under their normal schedule, you need to make your team to deliver somehow.
