                    Agile teams and Waterfall teams are completely, totally, unapologetically different from one another.

                    <p>Let’s start with Waterfall. Waterfall teams are basically what people who don’t know any of these terms imagine when they think about how large companies work on the inside. The teams used in Waterfall tend to be pretty large, if not bloated depending on who you ask. The structure of their team is quite rigid. Each member of the team is to be held responsible for a specific stage of the work. There’s no jumping around between tasks on different days, you stay where you’re assigned and you see it through. The manager on a Waterfall team makes sure everyone stays on track for the deadline. At a lot of places its the manager that gets the heat for not making a deadline, so he’s that much more motivated to make this work with the team that he has. This can sometimes lead to things like death-marches, depending on the manager you have.

                        Agile teams basically contrast a lot of the description for Waterfall teams. They are usually pretty small in size. They are small so that members can be interchangeable to other places, wherever they are needed most. A company with an Agile team working on something will have people above the people working on that team, but there usually isn’t a manager of the team itself. They are supposed to be self managing, and solve any and all issues in their project by communicating amongst themselves. Since there isn’t a manager and there isn’t a set deadline for the whole project, death-marches and the like are basically non-existent for Agile teams. They do, however, usually have one or more people to directly answer to in the form of customers or customer representatives. These people will check their progress after every sprint and can communicate issues the customer might have that need to be resolved in the next sprint.
