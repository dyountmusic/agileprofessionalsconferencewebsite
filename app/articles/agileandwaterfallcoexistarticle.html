                        There are many various organizations that follow diverse approaches for their project development life series. Strange enough, there will always be a competition between the two methodologies Agile and Waterfall. Although Agile is taking over the industry of project management, there are still some strengths and benefits in the Waterfall methodology that seems to still help stand its ground. When taking on a project, teams decide between one of the two and they would stick to that route for the duration of the project life. Of course there are pros and cons to both methodologies but surprisingly there are also ways that both agile and waterfall can coexist and possibly get along. First let’s quickly review both agile and waterfall methodologies and what they are are.

                        Agile methodology uses an iterative process where all the members of the teams cooperate allowing the client to gives responses throughout the whole process of developing a new product. It allows team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning. With each iteration in the project life cycle, there is always some result. Agile is most valued for its flexibility and its great for risk management. As the project becomes a series of iterations with constant feedback on each, its easier to track the project and foresee any issues before they arrive. Its mainly based on communication. Its not just flexible but it is quick. Waterfall is the traditional and time proven project management approach. Waterfall appeared manufacturing and construction. It’s a model that allows the execution of big and complex project that are very hard, or expensive or even impossible to change after the project as already begun. It takes on a linear approach. One stage has to be completed before the other is attempted. The layout stays the same. Each stage strictly follows one another just like a waterfall.

                        The Agile-Waterfall Hybrid is often measured a smart approach for implementing both methodologies without having to bargain too much, basically using the best of both worlds. The main goal of the hybrid methodology is to authorize teams to define requirements and adapt to shifting requirements through nonstop feedback and delivery. The hybrid method holds the clearness and tracing scheme of waterfall method, while including the compliance and flexibility of agile. According to Ulf Eriksson, “Water-scrum-fall method employs the traditional waterfall approach for planning, requirements gathering, budgeting and documenting the project’s progress. This method uses agile principles and scrum communication techniques in day-to-day activities related product development.” (12-6-16) So in conclusion, there are tools and ways dedicated for both methodologies to cooperate and share values from both to manage a project.
