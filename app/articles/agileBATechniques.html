                    <intro>Every Agile BA needs to know the right techniques, needs to possess the right skills, and needs to not only have, but also know how to use the tools at their disposal to make sure that this Agile cruise doesn’t turn into the Titanic.</intro>
                    <p>
                       Number one on the list of techniques is arguably one of the most important aspects of how Agile works as a system: retrospectives. Retrospectives are vital to the workflow of the business. They’re how you know where things are going well, but also where things are developing poorly. This is valuable information to have, and as a business analyst it is your job to obtain it. Another technique would be using personas. In businesses words like “user” and “customer” are thrown around quite a bit, which isn’t necessarily good. These words can distance yourself or even dehumanize the people out there using your product. That’s what personas aim to solve. Personas create a whole profile of a generic individual using your product. This profile will include things like hobbies/interests and it will use that and work in a specific problem they have that your product could solve. Looking at someones specific, real world issue and looking at how your product can solve or is supposed to solve it can really help a business. Yet another technique business analysts use is called backlog management. Backlog management is just managing a library of your requirements, largely ordered by level of importance. This can be done in programs like Microsoft Office.

                        Any business analyst worth their salt has to have some semblance of the skills I am about to tell you about. Top of the list would have to be communication. Business analysts need to be able to organize meetings, ask and answer questions efficiently in said meetings, and actually absorb the information without glossing over like some of us are tempted to do. Furthermore, a good business analyst can solve many of the problems your business faces. Problem solving skills are integral to their job. That is why the project or product even exists in the first place, to solve a problem. A business analyst has to be able to analyze this problem, determine or help determine the solution, and figure out the plausible scope of the project.

                        To get their job done right a business analyst needs to use a range of tools for each aspect of it. For making UML diagrams, generating data models, and making process flowcharts one could use something like Microsoft Visio. Of course they will also need a word processor like Microsoft Word for documenting mission critical requirements for the project. For crunching all the handy data gathered for the project one might use Microsoft Excel, or another program like it. For managing the requirements of the project you’d really want to use something like Microsoft Project or Rational Requisite Pro. For collaboration there is a wide, wide array of programs built specially to suit your needs for any specific collaboration challenge you may face. If you need to share non-confidential documents Google Docs works just fine, however if you need to work with the progression of software development you will want to use Git and possibly Git UI software of some sort. Finally, a business analyst needs to present the project or different aspects of the project at some point to stakeholders and any other individuals they answer to. For a professional presentation there really is no contest to using Microsoft Powerpoint or Keynote.

                    These are just some of the skills, techniques, and tools used by business analysts to get their projects done. Some might find that they need something more niche for a very specific problem with their project. Others might try to get by without using a few of the tools listed here. Whatever  the case may be, be sure to use absolutely everything necessary to completing your project.
