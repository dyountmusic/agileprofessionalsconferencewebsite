                        The traditional project manager Is one that is generally known to be in command and control. Laying out what the team needs to do and when they need to do it. Dealing with the iron triangle of scope scheduling budget. Acting as kind of a military general would and ensuring that the team is following orders. Ensuring the team is following orders and completing what they need to complete when they need to complete. They expect that the team will follow their direction. But let’s consider and ask ourselves, Is there a role for a Project Manager in Agile?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Agile we have many teams in the environment and what usually happens when there are a lot of teams they tend to get out of alignment. The Project Manager comes in to help with that alignment because they possess the traits of being organized and balanced. A project manager can also help with contracts that need to be put in place. They seek the need to deal with contracts of the employees, from the vendors, or maybe anyone who is involved with the team during the project’s lifespan. Another aspect of a project manager it that they would be more focused on the executives, the leadership team and reporting to them the progress of projects. They report the results, the business results of projects, and ensuring the actual results expected are coming into play.

                        More straightforward points of how an Agile Project fits on the team: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: left"><strong>Requirements:</strong> The responsibility of ensuring the requirements are established and giving direction for the results and services being dispensed move from the project manager to the product owner.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li style="text-align: left"><strong>Task Assignments:</strong> Assigning tasks and getting the progress of the work completed transfers from the project manager to the team members.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li style="text-align: left"><strong>Removes Impediments:</strong> If the agile development team is unable to resolve issues within the team, for example external dependencies and challenges that are out of the team’s immediate control, the Scrum Master helps remove obstacles and support the team. (Dananthi Arnott. What is the Role of the Project Manager on an Agile Project?)</li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In conclusion, duties of a project manager would include “allocating and tracking the budget; communicating with outside stakeholders, contractors and others; maintaining the risk census with guidance from the team, product owners; and so on. This is a true agile project management role.” (What is Agile Project Management?)</p>
