                        Now that we have been a bit more informed with what Agile is and how it compares to the Waterfall methodology, we now introduce a very important role within Scrum, known as the Scrum Master. A Scrum Master, according to Metal Toad, is someone who has a higher level of commitment to the Agile team than most of the team members, because in order to be high performing, they need to be dependent on the Scrum Master(1). One important role that a Scrum Master has, is updating all story points and tickets in the backlog, which helps when scheduling sprints and scrum meetings. Because often, a lot needs to be tracked, so the Scrum Master’s help keep the Agile team constantly moving and, on their feet, with completing tasks that were assigned.

                        However, there is more value in being a Scrum Master than just setting up scrum meetings and adding work to the backlog. As a Scrum Master, one must always be alert of any external or internal factors that might influence the team’s productivity and the development cycle. An example of one of these factors would be something known as a blocker. A blocker is simply something that can disrupt the work flow, whether it’s an issue that arises in development or with the client. Something that one may have thought to be a minor issue, is suddenly causing havoc to the whole team, resulting in dissatisfied Product Owners and a QA team that now has more to their plate, because a small problem set them back in testing. These types of situations can slow down a sprint, and a Scrum Master often times best handles the appropriate ways to deal with these issues.

                        A Scrum Master holds a lot of responsibility in an Agile team. If you haven’t yet yourself been in the position of a Scrum Master, take the time to say thank you to the one on your team, for the value that they have brought to your team.
