                <intro>
                    Agile. Lately, it’s been seeming like nothing more than a buzzword. It seems that each time a new start-up appears, the only thing we hear is “Agile” along with “DevOps” or “bandwidth”. However, in reality, it’s more than just a buzzword.

                    <p>Since its appearance in the tech world, agile has been a real game changer in SDLC and methodologies. It is iterative, flexible and adaptive. It boosts frequent reviews, teamwork amongst team members, and promotes self-discipline and accountability in developers. Done correctly, agile not only saves a lot on time and money, it helps with customer collaboration and creating working software without focusing on documentation and processes.
                    </p>

                    <p>However, it might work for start-ups but using a new methodology in a software team that is used to other methodologies is a lot more complicated. A lot of companies are very used to still using waterfall methodology. Waterfall although it also focuses on team work and requirements, it is usually a longer and deeper process with more chances of scope creep and other issues evolving during the development process. It is inflexible to anything outside of the requirements and very standard. Due to the complications that arise with waterfall, a lot of development teams have decided to move into agile, but making this change is much more difficult and time consuming, since the new methodology has new processes in itself. Rather than changing methodologies dramatically, many teams have made the two into a hybrid methodology, as they continue in waterfall but slowly integrate agile concepts into their SDLC.
                    </p>

                    <p>One way to make a hybrid development process between Agile and Waterfall, is something called “Water-scrum-fall”1. In short, this approach still uses the advantages that waterfall brings like requirements gathering and planning. After all the specifics of the requirements have been made, the development process begins. This is where agile now comes in with it’s good use of scrum. Developing the project with known requirements and previous planning, now in iterations and prototyping tools. This now increases productivity, decreases costs and promotes quality software development.
