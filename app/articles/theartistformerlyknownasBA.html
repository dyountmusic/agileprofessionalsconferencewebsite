                    <intro>
                        I won’t lie or try to sugarcoat this article. I find the topic and discussion of Business Analyst roles and how they change to be one of the most dry and disinteresting things to discuss. I apologize if you, the reader, find the tone of this article to be pure apathy. Your analysis, however, would be spot on.

                        Agile methodology, much like the millennial generation, has “killed” several traditional ways of thinking and have flipped previously static and well understood roles on their head. One “casualty” of the surging popularity of agile methodology is the role of the BA (business analyst).

                        Business analysts have always had an important role in product development. They were the backbone of analyzing, and communicating where business value can be found in a product, future project, etc. Today, that job is mostly fulfilled by the product owner. The product owner communicates, finds business value and communicates priorities between the product team and the audience the product is trying to target.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the product owner should be passionate, and plugged into outlets that will directly effect how the product should be built and evolve. A fantastic product owner will come from a background which directly relates to the product they are managing. For example: if you have a team building an application that supports database administrators on MySQL platforms, a product owner that used to be a database admin for a company that uses MySQL will have an inherent understanding of what the audience needs and expects.

                        We have to move forward constantly to find better ways of operating and performing our tasks. Holding onto legacy operations and roles do us no favors in learning how to best build products and platforms for the future. Rest assured, though, the artist formerly known as business analyst is still alive and singing, just under a different pen name.
