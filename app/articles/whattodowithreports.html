                        Reports are very integral to the way that most projects work today. As a project manager you are expected to inform key stakeholders of various events and occurrences in the project, and one good and popular way of doing so is by utilizing the reports at your disposal.

                        Now what do you do with reports? Depends on your situation. If your team is running behind and you have management breathing down your neck you should probably use the report your have to find where the problem lies and either find a solution or at least tell management where your team is having issues. You could also use reports to your benefit when your team is ahead of schedule, they don't always have to be the bearer of bad news.

                         Reports can impact your future sprints in a very big way, which is good. If your team needs a new strategy, reports can tell you where to apply it. If your team is ahead overall but not as far ahead in one area, reports can figure out where for you. What this does for future sprints can be something minor, akin to a slight course correction, to something major, akin to throwing the wheel on the Titanic with your project’s iceberg in sight. An example of this can be seen in the graphic below, day 9 being when they righted the project’s course.
