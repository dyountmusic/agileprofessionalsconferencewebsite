                        	In previous articles we mentioned the important role that a Scrum Master carries in an Agile team. Leading the team in a way that makes everyone high-performing, is a high level of commitment on part of the Scrum Master. However, like most things in life, it is a two-way highway where the team must also do their part to make sure the development process runs smoothly. One important way of doing this is through reporting, which is an important method in agile that greatly benefits both the team as well as the Scrum Master. Because there are often so many stories to keep track of, it is important that monitoring and reporting of stories are done frequently throughout the sprints. There are different methods that are used in creating reports but the main idea is to make sure that they are simple to understand and use.

                        	Reporting holds a high value on an agile team and both the scrum master and the team benefit from it. Having reports and even better, graphic visuals of the progress, help to make sure that everyone on the team knows what kind of progress is being made. Also, since the Scrum Master is often in charge of making sure that any issues or roadblocks that occur, are taken care of, having quality reports of progress helps the Scrum Master keep things organized and be prepared for any issues that may arise.

                         Another high value that reporting holds to the agile team, is also based on customer and user expectations. Because Agile is based on accepting stories and presenting them to the client in a timely manner, reporting is beneficial here as well(Yrjola, 1). When reporting is done well, the progress can be shared with the user so that they can better understand the timeframe of the project and what to expect as development moves forward.
