                        We've all heard the term 'scrum master' in job interviews or out with your industry friends, but still to this day there seems to be a lot of confusion about what a scrum master actually does.

                        In all honesty, the role of a scrum master is insanely important but very easy to understand [1]. The scrum master exists to set and control the pacing of agile based sprints. Usually sprints are 2 to 4 weeks of work on a set of activities or stories that your company or organization has deemed has enough business value and sense to be worth working on during that cycle. Your scrum master is there to <em>help</em> you on your journey to complete those tasks. His/her job is to remove roadblocks or obstacles you may come across as soon as he can and as quickly as he can. This leaves you, the developer, to focus on the work at hand and not pay mind to fruitless distractions.

                        A scrum master is integral to agile and making it work successfully[2]. If they do their job properly, you might wonder why you even hired a scrum master in the first place. This is just a sign that they are doing their job so well. A great scrum master can make or break a project team. It's important to find one that fits the team and has a real passion for pipelining and streamlining tasks to completion quickly.
