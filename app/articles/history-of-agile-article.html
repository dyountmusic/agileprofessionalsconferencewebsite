                    It may not be referred to as such, but agile is more of an umbrella of development methods instead of an all encompassing method in itself. These methods include a number of lightweight methods like rapid action development, dynamic systems development method, the unified process, extreme programming, crystal clear, and scrum.

                        The real real unification of these processes and the establishment of agile development came when seventeen software developers held a meeting at the Snowbird resort, in Utah, to discuss methods of lightweight development. What came to fruition because of this meeting, held in February, 2001, was the Manifesto for agile Software Development. This manifesto laid out twelve principles that followers of agile adhere to in their day to day lives. These principles go as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
                        <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</li>
                        <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
                        <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
                        <li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
                        <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
                        <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                        <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
                        <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
                        <li>Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.</li>
                        <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
                        <li>At regular intervals, the teams reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        That meeting is what really kicked off this agile thing, but these principles were practiced in some form or another long before it. In fact the whole goal of the meeting itself was not to start agile really, the terms they were using at the time were more akin to “lightweight”. They were not really too much against the methods used at the time either, they just wanted to improve on them. Those methods, introduced mostly from the 70’s to the 90’s [2], borrowed from traditional engineering practices and catered them more towards software engineering. This was to get away from the insanely unorganized and inefficient practices of the 50’s and 60’s. This approach became known as waterfall. Some of the problems of waterfall seen today are actually not a result of waterfall directly, but a result of business structure. Waterfall was originally designed to accommodate changes and alterations to project decisions [3], but the way businesses are organized today make this impossible under the waterfall structure. So in essence the whole meeting in which the manifesto appeared from was really to fix some of the problems that emerged over the decades with how businesses used waterfall, not necessarily waterfall itself.

                        Whatever the case may be, agile is here to stay it seems with many praising its efficiency. It has found success, and is being used by thousands of developers and on every continent. That being said it is not the end all be all of software development. Sure agility got us here, but what will drive us into the future will be something faster, something more efficient, and something that will have a similar effect on developers to agile.
