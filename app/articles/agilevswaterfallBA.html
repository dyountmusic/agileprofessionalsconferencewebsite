                        Since we previously wrote about the general comparisons between Agile and Waterfall, we thought it might be a good idea to see how this ties into Business Analysis and see how the two compare when it comes to this part of SDLC. When the focus of BA is developing and maintaining the specifics and requirements of a software project, there needs to be a good understanding on the team, on how these requirements need to actually be carried out. Depending on which methodology the team works with, this can create a different end result.

                        With Waterfall BA, the focus is a lot more on the documentation and detail of each requirement. Because of the heavy focus on planning and documenting, the requirements, which are defined forehand, most often consist of wireframes, business rules, and functional requirements. Moving forward, since Waterfall is generally not very flexible, any kind of changes need to go through a heavy pre-approval and control before they can be implemented and often the requirements are not negotiable. Another common difference with Waterfall is that the Business Analyst is separated from the engineering team. Most days, they are working separately, and this can lead to a lot of inconsistencies if everyone is not physically working together.

                        Agile BA goes hand in hand with the methodology that it represents. Since it focuses specifically on the problem, the BA focuses on doing everything they can to communicate the requirements to the engineering team correctly, so that when it comes time to release and deliver, the requirements are met. Since the BA is actually present on the team and works directly with them, they follow the same scrum practices, so this includes focusing the project on iterations and sprints, with backlogs and epics and user stories. If there ever need to be any changes made to the requirements, the Agile BA handles this better than a Waterfall BA. Changes are most often approved and even anticipated. If following the methodology correctly, adding any changes will not affect delivery of the product. A good BA takes good care of any changes by providing quick and appropriate feedback when needed. With a solid understanding and focus on the product, the turnaround with Agile is quick and any results that are made follow the business requirements.
